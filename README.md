The algorithms tend to better model seasonality and underlying trends in a given dataset

In this project, my objectives are to:

2. Develop a command line python application that anyone can use to generate high power forecasts by simply passing a time series input file as an argument
3. Forecast prices for Gold, palladium and some popular stocks
